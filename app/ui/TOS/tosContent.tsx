        By selecting the "I Agree" checkbox on the checkout screen you agree/promise as a
        condition of this sale that you will abide by the laws in place where
        you use these fireworks. Failure to do so could result in fines and/or
        confiscation of products. We will not be held responsible in any way for
        any injuries or such that may occur while using these fireworks. If your
        order does not comply with the following rules, we reserve the right to
        cancel your order.

        Once these products leave our facilities they are then your
        responsibility. These fireworks are sold on the basis that they will be
        used properly, that the buyer and the user of these fireworks is at
        least 18 years of age, and that they have all necessary permits to
        possess, store, and use these fireworks (if your state/county/city
        requires one). Gainesville Fireworks will not be held responsible for
        fines and/or confiscation of property due to false information given by
        the buyer and/or user of these items. We inspect the quality of all our
        products, but we cannot control their handling after they have left our
        facilities. In addition, we do not make these fireworks, and make no
        guarantees as to their performance. Any problems of that nature must be
        resolved through the manufacturer of the item(s). Gainesville Fireworks 
        reserves the right to substitute items of equal or greater value.
        Any legal disputes arising from this transaction will be litigated in
        Gainesville, FL. All sales are final.</p>
